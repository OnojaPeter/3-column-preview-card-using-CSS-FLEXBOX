## My process

### Built with
Css Flexbox

### What I learned
Most important lesson i learnt was that i was able to use my eyes to get some dimensions that look almost perfect to the intended image to replicate. Also the use of the hover states was quite interesting.

### continued development
I will like to further my education on other displays like Css Grid to be able to do this design
